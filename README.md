## Installation and Setup

### Prerequisites

- **Python 3.8+**
- **Jupyter Notebook**
- Recommended: Create a virtual environment using `venv` or `conda`.

### 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/knightempire/travel.git
cd travel/ml
```

### 2. Set Up Virtual Environment

Create and activate a virtual environment:

```bash
# Create virtual environment
python -m venv venv

# Activate (Windows)
venv\Scripts\activate

# Activate (macOS/Linux)
source venv/bin/activate
```

### 3. Install Dependencies

Install the required Python packages:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 4. Launch Jupyter Notebook

Start the Jupyter Notebook server to access ML scripts:

```bash
jupyter notebook
```

## Directory Structure

- **notebooks/**: Contains Jupyter Notebooks for model development and testing.
- **data/**: Placeholder for datasets used in model training and evaluation.
- **models/**: Saved ML models and configurations.
- **scripts/**: Utility scripts for data preprocessing and feature engineering.

## Dataset Requirements

Ensure you have the necessary datasets in the `data/` directory before running any scripts. Example datasets might include user preferences, travel histories, and destination details.

## Usage

1. Load the datasets in the appropriate notebook.
2. Run the preprocessing scripts to clean and prepare the data.
3. Train the models and evaluate their performance.
4. Save the trained models for integration with the backend.

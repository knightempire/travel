# Travel Recommendation System - Machine Learning (ML)

This is the **machine learning (ML)** module of the Travel Recommendation System project. It focuses on developing and deploying models to provide AI-powered travel recommendations, predict trends, and enhance user experiences.

## Features

- **Personalized Recommendations**: AI models to suggest destinations, activities, and experiences tailored to user preferences.
- **Travel Predictions**: Forecasts for travel trends, optimal visiting times, and cost estimates.
- **Model Training and Evaluation**: Using real-world data to train and validate ML models.
- **Data Preprocessing**: Cleaning and preparing data for machine learning.

## Tech Stack

- **Python**: Core programming language for ML development.
- **Jupyter Notebooks**: For developing, visualizing, and testing ML workflows.
- **Pandas & NumPy**: Data manipulation and preprocessing.
- **Scikit-learn**: For implementing machine learning algorithms.
- **TensorFlow & PyTorch**: Advanced frameworks for building neural networks.
- **Matplotlib & Seaborn**: Visualization libraries for data analysis and model insights.

## Installation and Setup

### Prerequisites

- **Python 3.8+**
- **Jupyter Notebook**
- Recommended: Create a virtual environment using `venv` or `conda`.

### 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/knightempire/travel.git
cd travel/ml
```

### 2. Set Up Virtual Environment

Create and activate a virtual environment:

```bash
# Create virtual environment
python -m venv venv

# Activate (Windows)
venv\Scripts\activate

# Activate (macOS/Linux)
source venv/bin/activate
```

### 3. Install Dependencies

Install the required Python packages:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 4. Launch Jupyter Notebook

Start the Jupyter Notebook server to access ML scripts:

```bash
jupyter notebook
```

## Directory Structure

- **notebooks/**: Contains Jupyter Notebooks for model development and testing.
- **data/**: Placeholder for datasets used in model training and evaluation.
- **models/**: Saved ML models and configurations.
- **scripts/**: Utility scripts for data preprocessing and feature engineering.

## Dataset Requirements

Ensure you have the necessary datasets in the `data/` directory before running any scripts. Example datasets might include user preferences, travel histories, and destination details.

## Usage

1. Load the datasets in the appropriate notebook.
2. Run the preprocessing scripts to clean and prepare the data.
3. Train the models and evaluate their performance.
4. Save the trained models for integration with the backend.
